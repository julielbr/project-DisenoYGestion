# Genomic Data Transformation Project
This project is part of the course "Dise침o y Gesti칩n de Sistemas de Informaci칩n Gen칩micos" for the Spring 2024 semester. 
The goal of this project is to facilitate the efficient storage, retrieval, and management of genomic data using relational databases.
This involves transforming genomic data from CSV files and loading them into a MySQL database hosted on Clever Cloud.

The project is divided into several tasks: 
  - downloading genomic datasets,
  - annotating genetic variants (using snpEff),
  - transforming the data into a common format (CSV-file from the vcf file), 
  - storing it in a relational database
